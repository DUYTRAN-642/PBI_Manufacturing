# LL Mountain Seat Assembly - Production Dashboard

**Project Overview**

This project focuses on developing an interactive and insightful Power BI dashboard for the Production Director of LL Mountain Seat Assembly. The primary goal is to provide a clear, visual overview of the production operations, enabling data-driven decision-making and process improvement.

**Key Objectives**

* **Operational Visibility:** Create a comprehensive dashboard that offers a snapshot of the current production status.
* **Performance Analysis:** Analyze key metrics such as production time, delays, and scrap rates to identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement.
* **Actionable Insights:** Provide data-backed recommendations to optimize the production process and enhance efficiency.

**Methodology**

* **Data Collection:** Gather relevant data on work orders, production times, delays, and scrap reasons (as provided in "Project3_Trần Khánh Duy_K31.pdf").
* **Power BI Development:** Design and develop an intuitive dashboard with interactive charts, graphs, and tables to visualize the data.
* **Analysis and Insights:** Analyze the data to derive meaningful insights and identify trends, patterns, and areas for improvement.
* **Recommendations:** Based on the analysis, provide actionable recommendations to the Production Director.

**Key Metrics (Based on Provided Data)**

* **Total Work Orders:** 326
* **Average Production Time:** 16.78 days
* **Delay Percentage:** 51.5%
* **Scrapped Quantity:** 17 units
* **Scrap Reasons:** Thermoform temperature (1 unit), Unknown (16 units)
* **Production Time Trends:** Displayed by month from July 2013 to May 2014.
* **Average Number of Delay Dates:** 15.6 days
* **Difference Between Scheduled and Actual Times:** Displayed by month from April 2013 to April 2014 for Final Assembly and Subassembly.
* **Average of Startdate diff and Average of Enddate diff by Year and Quarter**

**Dashboard Features**

* Interactive visualizations for easy data exploration
* Key performance indicators (KPIs) for quick insights
* Filters and slicers for customized data views (e.g., by date, scrap reason).
* Trend analysis to identify patterns and anomalies.

**Brainstorming for Metrics and Charts**

**I. Understanding the Objectives (Based on Provided Data)**

* The Production Director needs to understand overall production efficiency, delays, and scrap rates.
* Focus on identifying areas where production time can be reduced and quality improved.

**II. Identifying Key Metrics (Based on Provided Data)**

* **Core Metrics:**
    * Total Work Orders (326): Overall production volume.
    * Average Production Time (16.78 days): Efficiency and speed of production.
    * Delay Percentage (51.5%): Bottlenecks and potential issues.
    * Scrapped Quantity (17 units): Quality control and waste reduction.
* **Supporting Metrics:**
    * Production Time Trends (Monthly): Identifying patterns and seasonality.
    * Scrap Reasons (Thermoform temperature, Unknown): Addressing quality issues.
    * Difference Between Scheduled and Actual Times (Monthly): accuracy in planning and execution.
    * Average delay dates.
    * Average of startdate diff and Average of enddate diff.

**III. Choosing the Right Charts (Based on Provided Data)**

* **Overall Performance:**
    * Cards: Displaying Total Work Orders, Average Production Time, Delay Percentage, Scrapped Quantity.
* **Trends and Patterns:**
    * Line Charts: Visualizing Production Time Trends over time (monthly).
    * Column Charts: Comparing scheduled vs actual times for sub and final assembly.
    * Column chart: Average of start and end date diff by year and quarter.
* **Categorical Data:**
    * Pie Chart: Showing the distribution of scrap reasons.
    * Table: Displaying the cost matrix.
* **Time Based data**
    * Line chart: Displaying the Average number of delay dates.

**Insights and Recommendations (Based on Provided Data)**

* **High Delay Percentage (51.5%):** Investigate the root causes of delays and implement measures to reduce them.
* **Significant Scrap Quantity (17 units):** Focus on quality control, particularly addressing the Thermoform temperature issue. Further investigate the large number of unknown scrapped reasons.
* **Production Time Trends:** Analyze the fluctuations in production time to identify potential bottlenecks or seasonal variations.
* **Scheduled vs. Actual Times:** Address the differences between scheduled and actual times to improve planning and execution accuracy.
* **Cost Matrix:** Review the cost matrix for possible cost reductions.
* **Sub assembly vs final assembly:** Research why there is such a difference in the time spent between sub assembly and final assembly.

**How to Use This Dashboard**

The dashboard is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive. The Production Director can use it to:

* Monitor the current production status.
* Identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement.
* Track key performance indicators (KPIs).
* Make data-driven decisions to optimize the production process.

**Future Enhancements**

* Incorporate more detailed data on work orders and production processes.
* Develop predictive models to forecast production times and potential delays.
* Integrate with other systems for a holistic view of the manufacturing operations.
